WorkManager is for tasks to be executed reliably and fully. Even if app is in background, closed or
the device was restarted.

In work manager there are three different tasks:
Immediate tasks - tasks that need to be done immediately, that will finish soon
Long-running tasks - tasks that run long (large file download)
Differable tasks - tasks not to be done immediately, they are scheduled at a later point
                 - workmanager schedules them, and makes them one-time or repeatable
                    (example if app needs to sync with server every hour, workmanager will do the task
                    with out the user needing to launch the app)
                 - all these workmanager tasks are stored in a database so they will execute even at restart

If a scheduled task requires Internet access and on execution the user does not provide it. WorkManager
will save the task and execute when internet will be available.
